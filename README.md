Getting the app to run:

1. Pull from the branch feature/user_posts
2. Follow this tutorial on setting up and starting a python virtual environment: http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/
You should create the virtual environment in the same directory as manage.py.
3. After activating your venv, run the command pip install -r requirements.tx
   
   This should install django version 1.8 if you are running version 1.10.
